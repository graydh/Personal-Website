As I have been building this website, I've been considering what sort of structure I should follow for documenting both my overall progress on independent projects as well as my personal development. I have decided to split posts into two general categories with associated goals:

- **Blog**
	- Will consist of quasi-'random' updates regarding my independent work, academic life, goals and career progress. 
	- Maintain an average posting frequency of once per month
	- Updates regarding significant life events
	- Outline my thoughts and focus
- **Portfolio**
	- Will consist of less frequent larger posts explaining a certain project and diving into my technical implementation and progress 
	- Document a project at least once a season
	- Publication style structure
	- Projects involving data science, MEF and technology
